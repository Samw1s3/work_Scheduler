Interactice calendar to book out time in a work day. 
##  Description
This calendar allows the user to plan their day in hourly blocks. The time that has past turns grey, current time is green and time in the future is red. User types in the middle box to set reminders or provide information about the task, then they click the save button. This saves the text to their local storage. A reset button was added for improved user functionality, in case they make a mistake and want to restart the day.
